## Functions:

### Evaluation : 
After the learning process is over, you can see the success rate of the trained model using this file


### Model Training : 
Here the model is defined and it is used to train the data


### Data Generator : 
In this file, after bucketing, the normalized data is ready to go to the model and start the learning process


### PreProcessor : 
In this file, the normalization operation on the read data is called


### Data Loader : 
In this file, the given raw data is prepared for further processing
